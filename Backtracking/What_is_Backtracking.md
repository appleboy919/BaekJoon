# What is 'Backtracking' algorithm?

- Algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems
    - "Constraint satisfaction problems _(CSP)_"
- Technique for listing all possible solutions for a combinatorial algorithm
 problem --> solving problems recursively by removing solutions that fails
